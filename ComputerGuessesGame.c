/*
Ask the user to select a number. Then the program (computer) should guess and ask the user whether it's guess is correct, higher or lower. 
The user enters an appropriate response. It is up to you to decide how the user indicates correct, higher or lower (hint: string comparison is best avoided). 
Your program should implement a sensible guessing strategy. Try to implement the optimal strategy.
